# Permutation
A simple algorithmic task to convert integer input in all possible orders

For example:
* If the input provided is: “236”, then your solution should return 
"632,623,362,326,263,236" as these are all the combination that can be made with 
integers that the string contains
* If the input provided is: “A 3B2 C6D”, then your solution should return 
"632,623,362,326,263,236" as well, but this time notice that the provided string had nonintegers characters and whitespaces, so an extraction of integers was first made to 
obtain the correct solution
* If the input provided does not contain any integers: “ABC”, then your solution should 
return the appropriate error exception message.
